# DODS
Data Oriented Design Structs

#[derive(SoA)]
This generates FooSoA, FooRef, FooRefMut, FooSlice, FooSliceMut,
FooPtr, and FooPtrMut for a Foo struct, plus a Vec-like API on FooSoA.

#[derive(SoA)]
pub struct SensorReading {
    pub temperature: f32,
    pub pressure: f32,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}

and under the hood you get

/// Generated by #[derive(SoA)]
pub struct SensorReadingSoA {
    pub temperature: Vec<f32>,
    pub pressure: Vec<f32>,
    pub timestamp: Vec<u64>,
}

And gives you a standard API for working with vectors/slices making your structs simpler to work with.
